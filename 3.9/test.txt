Write a function that will print this in a readable form
so that duplicates are removed and adjacent numbers are put into
range. You might like to think of this via function wich turns
list of the earlier list of occurences into a list like
[{1,2},{4,6},{98,98},{100,100},{102,102}]
through a sequence of transformations.
